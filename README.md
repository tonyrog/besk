# BESK - Bin√§r Elektronisk SekvensKalkylator

This project emulate, simulate and replicate the BESK computer.
BESK was Sweden's first electronic computer. It was ready for use around 1953

and an electrical type writer was used for input and output. 
There where also two cathode ray tubes for function display, one of the
